# TODO

Plans to be considered in the future:

- support user-defined plugins loaded from predefined location (~/.cada/plugins)
- ascending/descending sorting
- sorting by size, by creation date/time etc, e.g. `'mv {} {i}_{}' -k 't.c'`
- index should not be incremented for skipped rows
- don't print progress when not atty
